		<h2>What is a summer camp?</h2>
		<p>A summer camp is a journey organized for teenagers during summer. It is an occasion for them to discover countries and meet people from all around the world. At the beginning, it was an american thing, then it opened to the rest of the world. Nowadays, either you're french, italian or russian you can be a part this experience. During a summer camp, you practice english in different activities such as class, sports and many other group activities.</p>

	<div id="why" class="card">
		<h2>Why is it important to experience different cultures?</h2>
		<p>Discovering a whole new culture is the core of a summer camp. You leave your house and family for trips between 2 weeks and 2 months. You thus get the chance to live in another country with a different culture and with people of your age from infinite origins. Experiencing new cultures is essential in your social development. A different culture has always a wealth to bring to your life. You then discover the habits and the typical behaviour of the local people. Summer camp is all about exchange because you also have your cultural habits that you can show to the others.
